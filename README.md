# Wheatley Discord Bot (ChatGPT backed OpenAI API bot to be precise, gpt3.5, 4, groq, lm-studio modes available)

## What is this?

Welcome to the Wheatley Discord Bot! This bot is designed to provide you with informative results from the web within the comfort of the Discord interface. With Wheatley, you can search Google, generate images based on your prompt, or just chat.

Bring ChatGPT/Groq/your local LLM with you everywhere via Discord.

I have a persona for Wheatley (the funny ai in Portal 2 voiced by Stephen Merchnat) but you are free to easily just change the variable to whatever persona you want.

## Disclaimer - I am not a programmer by trade! 
- I am learning as I go. I've used chatgpt to help me write this bot and now I just use this bot to help me write this bot.
- my code is probably a garbled mess though I do try to comment it nicely. chatgpt has helped me get to a working bot much faster than I should have so I'm sure I've skipped basic training as it were.
- I'm aware this is not pristine, but it works and it's fun and is an incredible learning experience for me
- feel free to give me pointers if you are just so appaled you can't stay quiet :) constructive criticism is always welcome, I may or may not have time to act on it.
- recently I have included a .env to help with variable setup, and a botFunctions.py to store some lengthy functions to help clean it up a lot

## Features

Usage:

üí¨Feel free to start chatting!
üôèDone with the conversation? Just say 'thanks' somewhere in your message. To reset your tokens.
üîéNeed current info? Say the words 'search' and 'please' somewhere in your message. (requires google api key and engine setup)
üñºÔ∏èWant a picture or four? Mention the word 'picture' or 'image' and 'generate'  in your message and describe what you'd like to see, as well as how many.
üì≤If you want to see more commands, just type !help
ü§ñAI Models Available: 
- !gpt3 - GPT-3.5-Turbo
- !gpt4 - GPT-4-Turbo
- !llm - {lmStudioModel}
- !groq - llama 3 70B

Summarize youtube videos or web articles
- just paste ONLY the URL in the chat and press enter
- This is a SUPER useful feature, I use it multiple times a day. It uses many tokens so best paired with lmstudio to do the summarizing for free locally

File management:

- There is no command here, just drop a text file in as an attachment, include a prompt within that file. The bot will respond within an attachment that it sends back to you. In this manner you can get around the 2000 word limit of discord. Especially useful when you want a massive prompt/response from GPT4.


## Getting Started

This is not a public bot. You are to copy the code and input your own API keys and pull it into a private discord server. There is no threading or anything setup so it can only handle one person/conversation at a time.

By default, the bot is named Wheatley with the same identity. However, you are free to change his identity by creating a new persona in the main code.

## Usage

Make liberal use of the thanks command to keep wiping history to save you api $$. 

Wheatley responds to any message posted in your server, he's currently designed for personal server use only because of this fact. It makes him much easier to talk to versus needing to make a thread everytime or mention him.
